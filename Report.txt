Linear Regression

I have store both the dataset of training and testing in variables
X and A. Then I have normalize the features and stored it in variables
train_f and test_f. Labels are stored in varibles Y and Y_test.
After normalizing the features I have added a column of ones. After this
I made a function named LinearRegression in which first I assigned theta
variable to an array of zeros and initialize cost_list variable. This variable
at the end will show the cost values so we can check wheather it is decreasing
or not, then I have made cost function and gradient descent. At the end the function
will return theta and cost_list. Then I have made a graph, checked rmse value and
accuracy using r2_score function of sci-kit learn library.

Accuracy of my program is 99.99538876832955 %

Polynomial Regression

Most of the coding is same as that of like Linear Regression. In addition
I have squared the values of both dataset and concatenate the squared values
with the dataset, then I have normalize the features and did the same as done in
Linear Regression.

Accuracy of my program is 99.92710293738281 %
